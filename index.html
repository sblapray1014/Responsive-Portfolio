            <p>As you just read, my name is Spencer LaPray, the guy behind SLCoding . . get it? I have a passion for problem
                solving and enjoy finding creative solutions to make life easier! This passion for problem solving led me
                to Web Design and Development! This line of "work" fulfills my curiosity at the deepest levels and brings
                me a high level of joy and excitement! </p>

            <p>I'm not your average "nerd", I've got a passion for sports unrivaled by . . well, almost anything. I'm an avid
                Utah Jazz and *cough* BYU *cough* fan. </p>

            <p>My passion for my work and designs will be evident as you browse through the contents of this portfolio! Have
                fun, laugh a little more and enjoy your life, my friends! </p>
